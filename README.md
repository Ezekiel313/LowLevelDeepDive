This repository is for my senior project which is accompanied by a published research paper on assembler implementation and compiler design. Within this respository
is the assembler and compiler I created for this project both of which are realized using my language of choice, Java. The purpose of this project is to increase
understanding of fundamental computing concepts such as tokenization, parsing, syntatical analysis, lexical analysis, instruction sets, computer organization and architecture, 
and other fundamental elements of computing systems.
